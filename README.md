The following assignment filters unique integers ranging from -1023 to 1023 using Python programming. The code runs on a Linux terminal where four input files have been imported directly into the Linux from my local storage. The code can read from the imported lists, which contain several integers, with many of them being repeated. I utilize data structures and algorithms to filter out unique integers from the extensive list of integers. The unique integers are then written into a new file, which is still created in the current directory when the code is executed. These new files have the unique integers written in them.
